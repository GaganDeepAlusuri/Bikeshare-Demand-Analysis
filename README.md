## Overview
Welcome to the Bikeshare Demand Analysis project repository. This project explores bike rental patterns using data analysis and statistical modeling. It aims to answer critical business questions related to bike rentals and factors influencing them.

## Project Files
- **Bikeshare Report**: [Link to Report](#) (Insert link to your report if available)
- **Bikeshare R File**: [Bikeshare.r](Bikeshare.r) (Insert link to your R code file)

## Data
The project utilizes the "Bikeshare.xlsx" dataset, which includes information on bike rentals, weather conditions, and timestamps. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed using R.

## Business Questions
This analysis addresses the following business questions:

A. **Effect of Weather**: Investigates the impact of weather on total, registered, and casual bike rentals.
B. **Weekend vs. Weekday Rentals**: Compares bike rentals during weekends and weekdays, considering holidays.
C. **Monthly Rental Counts**: Identifies months with the highest and lowest rental counts.
D. **Day of the Week Rental Counts**: Determines which days of the week have the highest and lowest rental counts.
E. **Hourly Rental Counts**: Identifies peak and off-peak hours for bike rentals.

## Statistical Models
The project employs various regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson regression, Quasi-Poisson regression, and Negative Binomial regression. These models help understand the relationships between variables and rental counts.

## Results
Detailed results, statistical summaries, and visualizations for each business question can be found in the R code file. Model evaluations and hypothesis testing outcomes are included.

## Limitations
- Overdispersion issues were addressed by using Quasi-Poisson and Negative Binomial models.
- Independence assumptions were not fully met in some models, suggesting potential exploration of time-series models like ARIMA.

## Conclusion
The Bikeshare Demand Analysis project provides valuable insights into bike rental patterns. It enhances our understanding of the factors affecting rentals and offers data-driven recommendations. Feel free to explore the code and results for a deeper understanding of bike rental demand in the dataset.
